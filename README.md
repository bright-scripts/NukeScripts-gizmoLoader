# Gizmo Loader for Nuke

## Setup:

1) Copy the contents of `init.py` into your `init.py` in your `.nuke` folder. (If you don't have a `init.py` in your `.nuke` folder, just copy in this one)
2) Copy the `gizmoLoaderPlugin` folder into your `.nuke` folder
3) Create a folder named `gizmoLoader` in your `.nuke/ToolSets` folder
4) Copy any gizmo files, you'd like the script to auto load, into the `.nuke/ToolSets/gizmoLoader` folder
    - You can organize them into folder structures inside the `.nuke/ToolSets/gizmoLoader` directory and the plugin will use that to build the menu structure inside Nuke
